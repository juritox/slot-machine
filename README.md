# Slot Machine Simulation

This is my first major project using Python classes and the Turtle module for graphics. 

## Project Overview
This repository contains a simple slot machine game simulation created for educational purposes. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming and graphical user interface elements in Python.

**Please Note:** This simulation is intended solely for educational purposes and does not involve real money gambling. It is designed to help learners understand basic programming concepts and game mechanics.
